# Countries Info Explorer

This project has as a main goal to provide basic information of a selected country.

## A simple observation

When planning vacations, a business trip, a move abroad, especially in a country we don't know about, we need to access its basic information (region, local language, capital, currency) in order to plan flights and travel.

### `A clean a responsive UI`

Thanks to a UI/UX orientation, and a good creativity sense, I used Javascript, Css, and React component in order to render a beautiful one-page HTML application to make the job done.

### `Using Api as data provider`

This front end application uses an open API to retrieve its data. It insures an always "up to date" information since it is maintained by an active community of users/administrators.

The Swagger API documentation makes it usable, maintainable, and evolutive.

See the API documentation about [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) for more information.

## `A vision of possible evolutions`

**Note: There are ways the project can evolve. None of these options has been choosed yet**

### Monetize the application by working on SEO and advertising on the UI

This is the quickest way to monetize the project, but it will seriously impact the UI/UX

### Add functionnalities

Use more APIs to make the application more capable (Hotel booking, Flights search, vehicule rental...)

### Catch the data of visitor in a local storage solution

Use the data of user, store it in a database, in order to sort/manipulate it, and monetize it.
